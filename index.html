            <h1>Care Near You in California</h1>  
            <h3>By Kavish Harjai and Irene Casado Sánchez</h3>
            <p>California has over <span class="bolded">2,100</span> mental health facilities throughout the state. More than half of them are concentrated in three urban areas: <span class="bolded">Los Angeles, Orange</span> and <span class="bolded">San Diego</span>. Meanwhile, <span class="bolded">12%</span> of counties –Alpine, Del Norte, Lassen, Madera, Modoc, Mono and Plumas– mainly rural and sparsely populated, do not have any mental health care facility, according to our <a href="https://github.com/irenecasado/CA_mental_health_facilities/blob/main/notebooks/data_analysis.ipynb">analysis</a>.</p>
            <p>Mental health disorders are among the most common <a href="https://www.chcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MentalHealthCalifornia2018.pdf">health conditions faced by Californians</a>: Nearly <span class="bolded">1 in 6</span> California adults experience a mental illness of some kind, and 1 in 24 have a serious mental illness that makes it difficult to carry out major life activities.</p>
            <p>Solving mental health-related illnesses requires proper attention. But, about <span class="bolded">two-thirds of adults</span> with a mental illness and <span class="bolded">two-thirds of adolescents</span> with major depressive episodes did not get treatment in California in 2018.</p>   
            <p><span class="bolded">Half of all Californians</span> consider that their community does not have enough mental health providers to meet its needs, as a <a href="https://www.chcf.org/publication/2019-california-health-policy-survey/">2019 statewide poll of California residents</a> shows.</p>
