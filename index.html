            <h1>Care Near You in California</h1>
            <p>Mental health disorders are among the most common <a href="https://www.chcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MentalHealthCalifornia2018.pdf">health conditions faced by Californians</a>: Nearly 1 in 6 California adults experience a mental illness of some kind, and 1 in 24 have a serious mental illness that makes it difficult to carry out major life activities.</p><p>Solving mental health-related illnesses requires proper attention. But, about two-thirds of adults with a mental illness and two-thirds of adolescents with major depressive episodes did not get treatment in California in 2018. The goal of this website is to help Californians find the mental health care they need.</p>
